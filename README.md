# Obsidian Plugin Groups

Manage your Plugins through groups. Enable and disable multiple plugins through a single command. Or delay the startup
of  plugins to speed up your Obsidian start up process.

## Use case:

Obsidian has a multitude of amazing plugins, I personally have over 20 plugins in daily use. However, this has caused
the startup time to slow down significantly to be annoying when wanting to quickly note something. 

In other cases having that many plugins open that I don't need or only for specific use cases slowed down the writing
process or hindered me in some way or form, so I wanted an option to quickly enable and disable the relevant plugins 
for the task at hand without having to search and en-/disable the plugins individually.

If this sounds like anything you've been struggling with this plugin might be of help to you as well.

## How to use:

1. Enable the Plugin
2. Create a new Plugin Group and give it a name
3. Add plugins
4. Save
5. Now you can en-/disable all plugins in this group either through the settings menu or through a command in
6. If you wish you can also add a startup group which will enable all the plugin groups within, with the defined delay after Obsidian started.

## Installation:

As this plugin is not yet in the public community plugin library you have 2 options:
1. Download the latest version from the release section on GitHub and manually copy the files into your `.obsidian/plugins` folder.
2. Add the plugin to Obsidian through the `BRAT community plugin`. (Copy the Link to this GitHub repo and add it through Brat)
